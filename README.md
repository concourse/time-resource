# Time Resource

Implements a resource that reports new versions on a configured interval. The
interval can be arbitrarily long.

This resource is built to satisfy "trigger this build at least once every 5
minutes," not "trigger this build on the 10th hour of every Sunday." That
level of precision is better left to other tools.

## Source Configuration

* `interval`: *Optional.* The interval on which to report new versions. Valid
  values: `60s`, `90m`, `1h`.

* `location`: *Optional.* The location on which time will be calculate. Valid
  values are a location name corresponding to a file in the IANA Time Zone database,
  such as "America/New_York". Defaults to `UTC`.

* `start` and `stop`: *Optional.* Only create new time versions between this
  time range. The supported formats for the times are: `3:04 PM -0800`, `3PM
  -0800`, `3 PM -0800`, `15:04 -0800`, `1504 -0800`, `3:04 PM`, `3PM`, `3 PM`
  , `15:04`, and `1504`.

  e.g.

  ```
  start: 8:00 +0100
  stop: 9:00 +0100
  ```

* `days`: *Optional.* Run only on this days. Supported days are: `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday` and `Saturday`

  e.g.

  ```
  days:
    - Monday
    - Wednesday
  ```

These can be combined to emit a new version on an interval during a particular
time period.

## Behavior

### `check`: Produce timestamps satisfying the interval.

Returns current version and new version only if it has been longer than `interval` since the
given version, or if there is no version given.


### `in`: Report the given time.

Fetches the given timestamp, writing the request's metadata to `input` in the
destination.

#### Parameters

*None.*


### `out`: Produce the current time.

Returns a version for the current timestamp. This can be used to record the
time within a build plan, e.g. after running some long-running task.

#### Parameters

*None.*


## Examples

### Periodic trigger

```yaml
resources:
- name: 5m
  type: time
  source: {interval: 5m}

jobs:
- name: something-every-5m
  plan:
  - get: 5m
    trigger: true
  - task: something
    config: # ...
```

### Trigger once within time range

```yaml
resources:
- name: after-midnight
  type: time
  source:
    start: 12:00 AM -0700
    stop: 1:00 AM -0700

jobs:
- name: something-after-midnight
  plan:
  - get: after-midnight
    trigger: true
  - task: something
    config: # ...
```

### Trigger on an interval within time range

```yaml
resources:
- name: 5m-during-midnight-hour
  type: time
  source:
    interval: 5m
    start: 12:00 AM -0700
    stop: 1:00 AM -0700

jobs:
- name: something-every-5m-during-midnight-hour
  plan:
  - get: 5m-during-midnight-hour
    trigger: true
  - task: something
    config: # ...
```
