# Time Resource

Implements a resource that reports new versions on a configured interval. The
interval can be arbitrarily long.

This resource is built to satisfy "trigger this build at least once every 5
minutes," not "trigger this build on the 10th hour of every Sunday." That
level of precision is better left to other tools.

## Source Configuration

* `interval`: *Optional.* The interval on which to report new versions. Valid
  units are: “ns”, “us” (or “µs”), “ms”, “s”, “m”, “h”. Examples: `60s`, `90m`,
  `1h30m`. If not specified, this resource will generate exactly 1 new version
  per calendar day on each of the valid `days`.

* `location`: *Optional. Default `UTC`.* The
  [location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) in
  which to interpret `start`, `stop`, and `days`.

  e.g.

  ```
  location: Africa/Abidjan
  ```

* `start` and `stop`: *Optional.* Limit the creation of new versions to times
  on/after `start` and before `stop`. The supported formats for the times are:
  `3:04 PM`, `3PM`, `3PM`, `15:04`, and `1504`. If a `start` is specified, a
  `stop` must also be specified, and vice versa. If neither value is specified,
  both values will default to `00:00` and this resource can generate a new
  version (based on `interval`) at any time of day.

  e.g.

  ```
  start: 8:00 PM
  stop: 9:00 PM
  ```

  **Deprecation: an offset may be appended, e.g. `+0700` or `-0400`, but you
  should use `location` instead.**

  To explicitly represent a full calendar day, set `start` and `stop` to
  the same value.

  e.g.

  ```
  start: 6:00 AM
  stop: 6:00 AM
  ```

  **Note: YAML parsers like PyYAML may parse time values in the 24h format as integers, not strings (e.g. `19:00` is parsed as `1140`). If you pre-process your pipeline configuration with such a parser this might trigger a marshaling error. In that case you can quote your `start` and `stop` values, so they will be correctly treated as string.**

* `days`: *Optional.* Limit the creation of new time versions to the specified
  day(s). Supported days are: `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`,
  `Thursday`, `Friday` and `Saturday`.

  e.g.

  ```
  days: [Monday, Wednesday]
  ```

  These can be combined to emit a new version on an interval during a particular
  time period.

* `initial_version`: *Optional.* When using `start` and `stop` as a trigger for
  a job, you will be unable to run the job manually until it goes into the
  configured time range for the first time (manual runs will work once the `time`
  resource has produced it's first version).

  To get around this issue, there are two approaches:
     * Use `initial_version: true`, which will produce a new version that is
       set to the current time, if `check` runs and there isn't already a version
       specified. **NOTE: This has a downside that if used with `trigger: true`, it will
       kick off the correlating job when the pipeline is first created, even
       outside of the specified window**.
     * Alternatively, once you push a pipeline that utilizes `start` and `stop`, run the
       following fly command to run the resource check from a previous point
       in time (see [this issue](https://github.com/concourse/time-resource/issues/24#issuecomment-689422764)
       for 6.x.x+ or [this issue](https://github.com/concourse/time-resource/issues/11#issuecomment-562385742)
       for older Concourse versions).

       ```
       fly -t <your target> \
         check-resource --resource <pipeline>/<your resource>
         --from "time:2000-01-01T00:00:00Z" # the important part
       ```

       This has the benefit that it shouldn't trigger that initial job run, but
       will still allow you to manually run the job if needed.

  e.g.

  ```
  initial_version: true
  ```
* `start_after`: *Optional.* Specifies the earliest datetime from which new time-based versions can be created.  

  Supported formats are `2006-01-02 15:04:05`, `2006-01-02T15:04:05`, `2006-01-02T15:04`, `2006-01-02T15`, `2006-01-02`.

  Behavior:
  - If the `start_after` datetime is specified and is in the future, it will determine when the first version is created.
  - If the `start_after` datetime is in the past, the resource will continue to generate versions based on the other configuration parameters.
  - When `initial_version` is set to true, the first version will be created based on the current time. Subsequent versions will only be generated if they fall after the `start_after` datetime.
  - If a `location` is provided, the `start_after` datetime will be interpreted in the context of the specified timezone, rather than in UTC.

  e.g.

  ```
  start_after: 2023-10-01T00:00:00
  ```
## Behavior

### `check`: Produce timestamps satisfying the interval.

Returns current version and new version only if it has been longer than `interval` since the
given version, or if there is no version given.


### `in`: Report the given time.

Fetches the given timestamp. Creates three files:
1. `input` which contains the request provided by Concourse
1. `timestamp` which contains the fetched version in the following format: `2006-01-02 15:04:05.999999999 -0700 MST`
1. `epoch` which contains the fetched version as a Unix epoch Timestamp (integer only)

#### Parameters

*None.*


### `out`: Produce the current time.

Returns a version for the current timestamp. This can be used to record the
time within a build plan, e.g. after running some long-running task.

#### Parameters

*None.*


## Examples

### Periodic trigger

```yaml
resources:
- name: 5m
  type: time
  source: {interval: 5m}

jobs:
- name: something-every-5m
  plan:
  - get: 5m
    trigger: true
  - task: something
    config: # ...
```

### Trigger once within time range

```yaml
resources:
- name: after-midnight
  type: time
  source:
    start: 12:00 AM
    stop: 1:00 AM
    location: Asia/Sakhalin

jobs:
- name: something-after-midnight
  plan:
  - get: after-midnight
    trigger: true
  - task: something
    config: # ...
```

### Trigger on an interval within time range

```yaml
resources:
- name: 5m-during-midnight-hour
  type: time
  source:
    interval: 5m
    start: 12:00 AM
    stop: 1:00 AM
    location: America/Bahia_Banderas

jobs:
- name: something-every-5m-during-midnight-hour
  plan:
  - get: 5m-during-midnight-hour
    trigger: true
  - task: something
    config: # ...
```

### Trigger on/after specific datetime set

```yaml
resources:
- name: time-based-resource
  type: time
  source:
    start_after: 2023-12-01T09:00:00
    location: America/New_York

jobs:
- name: process-time-based-resource
  plan:
  - get: time-based-resource
    trigger: true
  - task: process-data
    config: # ...
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

* golang is *required* - version 1.9.x is tested; earlier versions may also
  work.
* docker is *required* - version 17.06.x is tested; earlier versions may also
  work.
* go mod is used for dependency management of the golang packages.

### Running the tests

The tests have been embedded with the `Dockerfile`; ensuring that the testing
environment is consistent across any `docker` enabled platform. When the docker
image builds, the test are run inside the docker container, on failure they
will stop the build.

Run the tests with the following command:

```sh
docker build -t time-resource --target tests --build-arg base_image=concourse/resource-types-base-image-static:latest .
```

### Contributing

Please make all pull requests to the `master` branch and ensure tests pass
locally.
